netflix operates in two clouds, aws and openconnect. both coulds must work together seamlessly to deliver endless hours of video

netflix has 3 main components'
1. openconnect
2. backend
3. client 

high level working of netflix
client: a device from which you play video on, it could be desktop or andriod or iphone 
anything that does not invovle in video streaming is all handled in aws cloud 
anything which is invoved in streaming the video is completely handled by openconnect

what is openconnect?
openconnect is netflix's own CDN, it is a network of distributed servers that is maintained by netflix
CDN: content delivery network which is a network of distributed servers which are placed in different locations to serve the content much faster
we can ahve main server in one place and cache servr in other loactions , in this way we can reduce the time taken to deliver the data

what netflix has done is, they have placed lot of servers evry country, so that if the user is requesting a video a vedio data from very nearest server to the user
is played  

client: netflix supports lots of different devices, all these devices are writtent usig platform specific code 

elstic load balancer: netfix uses amazon's elastic load balancing service to route the traffic to different frontend  services
elastic load balancer is setup such a way that load is balanced across the zones first(nearest) and then across instances and this schema is called
as two tier balancing
first tier is consits of basic dns based round robin load balancing,when the request lands on the load balancer , it will balance across the zones using
round robin 
zones are kind of logical grouping of servers theer could be 3 ddifferent zones in one location and 1 zone in another location 
second tier of elastic load balancing service is the array of load balancers instances which does round robin load balancing
on the instances to distribute the requests across the instances
say fot ex when the req comes in, first tier distributes the load on different zones and the next tier distributes between the isntances

how netflix will onboards a video?
before a video or movie is made available to the users, what netflix does is it does do a lot of preprociessing and this preprocessing invovles finding errors
converting the video into different resolution, different format this process is called as transcoding or encoding
transcoding is a process that converts a video into different format and it will be optimized for particular kind of devies as netflix supports different devices
adaptive bitrate streaming?
netflix creates 1200 different copies of the same movie to paly the movie in different resolutions
and to do this netflix uses lot of different worker nodes to do that

when they wantto onboard a particular movie, they get the movie as a single file which is about say 50GB and then what they do is 
they break that movie into a lot of peices or chunks and put it all into the queue and these individual tasks
which needs to be processed for each clip will be placed in the queue and then these tasks will be picked up by the different workers and they all process
different chunks togetheer and then they merge all thes eprocessed clips and places them into amazon s3
